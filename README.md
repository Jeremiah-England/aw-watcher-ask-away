This [ActivityWatch](https://activitywatch.net) "watcher" asks you what you were doing in a pop-up dialogue when you get back to your computer from an AFK (away from keyboard) break.

## Installation

```console
pipx install aw-watcher-ask-away
```

([Need to install `pipx` first?](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/))

## Roadmap

Most of the improvements involve a more complicated pop-up window.

- Add common things people do when AFK to check boxes or something so everyone is not typing "bathroom" all the time.
  Make these "abbreviations" like fish or configurable keyboard shortcuts.
  Make this configurable from the pop-up window but seed it with some good defaults.
- Use something besides `tkinter`.
  Many useful text editing bindings are missing from the simple dialogue currently in use (e.g. Ctrl + Backspace for deleting a word).
- Handle calls better/stop asking what you were doing every couple minutes when in a call. See
- See whether people would rather add data to AFK events instead of creating a separate bucket. Maybe make that an option/configurable.

Note: I am using this project to get experience with the `hatch` project manager.
I have never use it before and I'm probably doing some things wrong there.
