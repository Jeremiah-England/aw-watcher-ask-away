        However, for some reason the events coming from the aw-server seem to be slightly inconsistent at times.
        For example, look at the logs below:

            2023-09-23 19:33:45 [DEBUG]: Got events from the server: [('2023-09-23T23:33:37.730000+00:00', 'not-afk'), ...]

        The second query returns an overlapping 'not-afk' event with a slightly earlier timestamp.
        This duplication + offset combination was causing us to double ask the user for input.
        Using overlaps with a percentage is more robust against this kind of thing.
